                            Bella Swan is the main protagonist of The Twilight Saga, a series of novels by Stephenie Meyer. She is a human girl who moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, where she falls in love with Edward Cullen, a
                            vampire. Bella is known for her introverted personality, clumsiness, and willingness to embrace the supernatural world. Over the course of the series, her relationships with Edward, Jacob Black (a werewolf), and
                            others drive the story's romantic and dramatic conflicts.
